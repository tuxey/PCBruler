# PCBruler

A **small PCB ruler** (100x32x1.6 mm) made with [KiCAD](https://kicad-pcb.org/).
It has a **milimiter ruler** both sides, a 1/8 **inch ruler** front side and a 1/10 inch ruler back side.
It has many useful tools for creating a new PCB, see Features section.


## Features:

* **Small form factor** (100x32 mm). 100 mm is the upper limit for very cheap manufacturing on many PCB fab stores. Also, being this size helps carrying it on any pocket or pencil case.
* **Transistor symbols**: BJT and MOSFET.
* **Common packages/footprints:**
    * **Capacitors/resistances/diodes** (C/R/diode), with its measures (in mm and inch) and its power (in mW).
    * **Diode footprints**: SMA, SMB, SOD-123, MELF, Mini MELF, Micro MELF.
    * **QFP footprints**: TQFP32, LQFP-32, QFN-32, QFN-28, QFN-16.
    * **SOP footprints**: SOIC8, TSOP-6, TSSOP-16.
    * **SOT footprints**: SOT89, SOT23-5, SOT323, SOT23, SOT223, SOD323.
* Common **pin pitches**: 1.0 mm, 1.27 mm, 2.0 mm, 2.54 mm, labeled with also its equivalences in inches.
* A table of the **Resistor Color Code**.
* A table of different **trace widths** and the corresponding **vias** (only above 12 mil). Also, the maximum current for each width, for temperatures of 10 °C and 50 °C.
* A lot of **artwork** covering all the empty spaces, mostly as traces with only artistic purpose, but also a few fiducials and test points. See for yourself.
* A **link** to [this page](https://github.com/tuxey/PCBruler) (unfortunately, the link on the PCB ruler is not clickable! :sweat_smile:).
* Some **logos** also covering the empty spaces.
